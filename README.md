Project Description: Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecommunication Sector
This project explored into the challenges faced by the telecommunication sector, primarily focusing on the phenomenon of customer churn. Using data-driven techniques, we aimed to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the service provider.

Key Components:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: We collected data relevant to customer behavior and demographics. This data went through rigorous preprocessing steps including normalization, outlier detection, and handling of missing values.

Feature Selection: Features were meticulously chosen based on their relevance and significance to the problem. This was achieved through a combination of domain knowledge and statistical methods.

Model Implementation & Iteration: Several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, were employed. Each algorithm went through multiple iterations with different sets of features and parameters to optimize performance.

Evaluation: Post-implementation, models were evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

Recommendation: After extensive evaluation and comparison, a model was recommended that showed the highest potential in accurately predicting customer churn, thereby aiding retention strategies in the telecommunication sector.

This research provides a robust framework for telecommunication entities to harness the power of machine learning for customer retention, offering a competitive advantage in an increasingly saturated mark.
